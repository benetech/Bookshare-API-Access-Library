END-OF-LIFE

This project has reached its end-of-life, and is stored here only for informational purposes.  Please don't add this library to any projects.

------------
INTRODUCTION
------------

API access library that connects to the Bookshare's webservice.
Services offered include ability to search for books using various criteria like authors, 
title etc.  Book download option is also provided.

This library is currently used only by Go Read. It should NOT be used for any new projects.  
This library uses API v.1.

-------
TESTING
-------

To use the unit tests, you will need to create a test.properties file in the 
src/test/resources directory.  This file is a Java properties file (see 
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/properties.html)

It contains the following 3 fields:

apikey=<YOUR API KEY>
username=<BOOKSHARE USER USERNAME>
password=<BOOKSHARE USER PASSWORD>

ANDROID AND HTTPCLIENT
----------------------

Android 17, the version currently in use by Go Read, uses a fork of the Apache HttpClient
class which has not been kept in sync with Apache's version.

See:
https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.3.x/android-port.html

For this reason, do not attempt to update the pom.xml httpclient version.  It will
break the interoperability with the Android fork.

When this .jar file is added to the Go Read project, it pulls the HttpClient classes from the
Android fork.  In this project, the HttpClient is pulled from the old Apache HttpClient library.

Google has deprecated any use of Apache's HttpClient as of version 22 and is encouraging users 
to move to a new API.
